# Test file for partial matching functionality

# Exact matches should still work
Lightning Bolt [LEA]

# Partial matches - query name is subset of card name
Ballista Watcher [VOW]           # Should match "Ballista Watcher // Ballista Wielder"
Arborea Pegasus (Showcase) [AFR] # Should match "Arborea Pegasus" (removing showcase variant)

# Regular fallback - different set
Lightning Bolt [M21]             # Should fallback to LEA

# No match
Nonexistent Card [FAKE]
